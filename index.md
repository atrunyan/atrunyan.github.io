## Bio
> I am a first year MS/PhD student in Ocean Engineering at the University of Rhode Island. My background is a bit nontraditional, as I studied Marine Science for my Bachelor degree with a minor in Physics and certificate in Data Science. I'm very passionate about ocean exploration and my research involves creating affordable surveying technology to better understand the deep sea.

### Work Experience

#### Diving Safety Assistant
> As a diving safety assistant at the University of Hawai'i Diving Safety Program, I aided in numerous scientific diver training courses, serviced University scuba equipment and tanks, and helped construct a new compressor system for our air fills. 
<br>

#### Research Assistant
> I worked under Dr. John Burns constructing 3D models of coral reef environments from high resolution benthic imagery. I then used the reconstructions to quantitatively assess the coral ecosystems and their growth/decay over time.

### Recent Projects

#### Automating Urchin Detection on High Resolution Benthic Imagery Using Machine Learning Techniques
> During my senior year at University of Hawai'i at Hilo, I conducted a research thesis developing an AI algorithm and training it to identify urchin species from benthic imagery in the Hawaiian Islands. This project was funded by NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center to aid in their long-term monitoring efforts of coral reefs and their inhabitants.
